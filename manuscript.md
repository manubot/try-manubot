## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Manubot is an open source tool for writing manuscripts on GitHub in markdown format.
Manubot applies the git-based software workflow to scholarly writing, enabling enhanced transparency, collaboration, automation, and reproducibility.

This manuscript is a Manubot demo, intended to give users a playground to practice using Manubot.
Everyone is encouraged to try writing with Manubot by editing this manuscript.

Manubot is described in the paper titled "Open collaborative writing with Manubot" [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review].


## Main text

Lorem ipsum text [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum] is a strong introduction for any manuscript.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

Manubot makes it easy to cite this manuscript [@url:https://manubot.github.io/try-manubot].
It has been used to write several manuscripts that are now preprints on _bioRxiv_ [@doi:10.1101/474403; @doi:10.1101/515940; @doi:10.1101/502484; @doi:10.1101/654566].
Notice that only [@doi:10.1101/502484] has the correct name of the preprint server.
Manubot allows authors to overwrite reference information, in this case with a BibTeX file.

Lorem ipsum also makes a strong conclusion [@PMID:26945319] here is another reference to see if duplicate references are picked up by the program if the second author uses a different identifier for the same reference like here with the immediately preceding reference [@doi:10.1097/MOT.0000000000000306]. Did it work?

I'm wondering about how editing this file works within the web browser.

Testing inserting a reference Note that some buffers can potentially introduce modifications onto proteins such as carbamylation from urea at high temperatures [@doi:10.1016/j.ab.2013.10.024; @doi:10.1016/j.ab.2021.114321] . 

Trying with references again [@PMID:24161613]

### The global NAP for the country as a whole can be summarised as follows: ###
|**ADAPTATION OBJECTIVES: Protect accelerated growth pillars**  |**ADAPTATION MEASURES AT SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM**|
|--|--|
| Agriculture | -	Cultivate early varieties or drought-resistant crops (Short) - Apply water and soil conservation methods (stone barriers, small dikes, filtering dikes, terraces, half moons, agroforestry, dune fixing etc.) (Short) - Promote sustainable land management (SLM) (Medium) - Improve access to climate information  (Medium) - Introduce agricultural insurance (Long) |
|Livestock farming | -	Fight bush fires in order to prevent destruction [@doi:10.1136/bmj.312.7031.619] of dry-season grazing reserves-  Adopt best animal husbandry and pastoral practices (pastoral hydraulics, pastoral resource management, pasture mowing and conservation, pasture crops, silage, animal mobility and transhumance etc.) - Ensure stakeholders take account of climate variability in development project and programme planning by improving their skills - Preserve cattle breeding at serious risk from climate variability  - Ensure farmers adopt animal production methods adapted to a hot climate|

I wonder what happens if I do hto

Great Idea!

Testing some identifier types [@bioproject:PRJDB3] and [@4dn:4DNES265ETYQ] and [@geo:GDS1234]
