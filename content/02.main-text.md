## Main text

Lorem ipsum text [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum] is a strong introduction for any manuscript.

Manubot makes it easy to cite this manuscript [@url:https://manubot.github.io/try-manubot].
It has been used to write several manuscripts that are now preprints on _bioRxiv_ [@doi:10.1101/474403; @doi:10.1101/515940; @doi:10.1101/502484; @doi:10.1101/654566].
Notice that only [@doi:10.1101/502484] has the correct name of the preprint server.
Manubot allows authors to overwrite reference information, in this case with a BibTeX file.

Lorem ipsum also makes a strong conclusion [@PMID:26945319] here is another reference to see if duplicate references are picked up by the program if the second author uses a different identifier for the same reference like here with the immediately preceding reference [@doi:10.1097/MOT.0000000000000306]. Did it work?

I'm wondering about how editing this file works within the web browser.

Testing inserting a reference Note that some buffers can potentially introduce modifications onto proteins such as carbamylation from urea at high temperatures [@doi:10.1016/j.ab.2013.10.024; @doi:10.1016/j.ab.2021.114321] . 

Trying with references again [@PMID:24161613]

### The global NAP for the country as a whole can be summarised as follows: ###
|**ADAPTATION OBJECTIVES: Protect accelerated growth pillars**  |**ADAPTATION MEASURES AT SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM**|
|--|--|
| Agriculture | -	Cultivate early varieties or drought-resistant crops (Short) - Apply water and soil conservation methods (stone barriers, small dikes, filtering dikes, terraces, half moons, agroforestry, dune fixing etc.) (Short) - Promote sustainable land management (SLM) (Medium) - Improve access to climate information  (Medium) - Introduce agricultural insurance (Long) |
|Livestock farming | -	Fight bush fires in order to prevent destruction [@doi:10.1136/bmj.312.7031.619] of dry-season grazing reserves-  Adopt best animal husbandry and pastoral practices (pastoral hydraulics, pastoral resource management, pasture mowing and conservation, pasture crops, silage, animal mobility and transhumance etc.) - Ensure stakeholders take account of climate variability in development project and programme planning by improving their skills - Preserve cattle breeding at serious risk from climate variability  - Ensure farmers adopt animal production methods adapted to a hot climate|

I wonder what happens if I do hto

Great Idea!
