# Building the manuscript

[`build.sh`](build.sh) builds the repository.
`bash build/build.sh` should be executed from the root directory of the repository.
By default, `build.sh` creates HTML and PDF outputs.
However, setting the `BUILD_PDF` environment variable to `false` will suppress PDF output.
For example, run local builds using the command `BUILD_PDF=false bash build/build.sh`.

To build a DOCX file of the manuscript, set the `BUILD_DOCX` environment variable to `true`.
For example, use the command `BUILD_DOCX=true bash build/build.sh` locally.
To export DOCX for all CI builds, set an environment variable in the CI configuration file.
For GitHub Actions, set the variable in `.github\workflows\manubot.yaml` (see [docs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables)):

```yaml
name: Manubot
env:
  BUILD_DOCX: true
```

To generate a single DOCX output of the latest manuscript with GitHub Actions, click the "Actions" tab at the top of the repository.
Select the "Manubot" workflow, then the "Run workflow" button and check "generate DOCX output" before clicking the green "Run workflow" button.

Currently, equation numbers via `pandoc-eqnos` are not supported for DOCX output.

Format conversion is done using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).
`build.sh` calls `pandoc` commands using the options specified in [`pandoc/defaults`](pandoc/defaults).
Each file specifies a set of pandoc `--defaults` options for a given format.
To change the options, either edit the YAML files directly or add additional `--defaults` files.

## Environment

Note: currently, **Windows is not supported**.

The Manubot environment is managed with [conda](https://conda.io).
If you do not have `conda` installed, we recommend using the Miniforge3 installer from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) (includes `conda` and `mamba`).
Install the environment from [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) by running one of following commands
(from the repository's root directory):

```sh
# Install the environment using conda
conda env create --file build/environment.yml

# Install the environment using mamba (faster)
mamba env create --file build/environment.yml
```

If the `manubot` environment is already installed, but needs to be updated to reflect changes to `environment.yml`, use one of the following options:

```shell
# option 1: update the existing environment.
conda env update --file build/environment.yml

# option 2: remove and reinstall the manubot environment.
# Slower than option 1, but guarantees a fresh environment.
conda env remove --name manubot
conda env create --file build/environment.yml

# option 3: reinstall the manubot environment faster using mamba.
mamba env create --force --file build/environment.yml
```

Activate with `conda activate manubot` (assumes `conda` version of [at least](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/9d759d8edeb86569c25f6eb82053f09581013a2a/CHANGELOG.md#440-2017-12-20) 4.4).
The environment should successfully install on both Linux and macOS.
However, it will fail on Windows due to the [`pango`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pango) dependency.

Because the build process is dependent on having the appropriate version of the `manubot` Python package,
it is necessary to use the version specified in `environment.yml`.
The latest `manubot` release on PyPI may not be compatible with the latest version of this rootstock repository.

## Building PDFs

If Docker is available, `build.sh` uses the [Athena](https://www.athenapdf.com/) [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/arachnysdocker/athenapdf) to build the PDF.
Otherwise, `build.sh` uses [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) to build the PDF.
It is common for WeasyPrint to generate many warnings and errors that can be safely ignored.
Examples are shown below:

```text
WARNING: Ignored `pointer-events: none` at 3:16, unknown property.
WARNING: Ignored `font-display:auto` at 1:53114, descriptor not supported.
ERROR: Failed to load font at "https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.2/webfonts/fa-brands-400.eot#iefix"
WARNING: Expected a media type, got only/**/screen
```
