The concerted action of TFs within the chromatin context enables precise temporal and spatial expression patterns. To understand how TFs control gene expression it is essential to model TF binding. TF motif information can help to interpret the exact role of individual regulatory elements, for instance to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Here we present GimmeMotifs, a comprehensive computational framework for TF motif analysis. Compared to the previously published version, this release adds a whole range of new functionality and analysis methods. It now includes tools for <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif discovery, motif scanning and sequence analysis, motif clustering, calculation of performance metrics and visualization. Included with GimmeMotifs is a non-redundant database of clustered motifs. Compared to other motif databases, this collection of motifs shows competitive performance in discriminating bound from unbound sequences. Using our <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif discovery pipeline we find large differences in performance between <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> motif finders on ChIP-seq data. Using an ensemble method such as implemented in GimmeMotifs will generally result in improved motif identification compared to a single motif finder. Finally, we demonstrate <jats:italic>maelstrom</jats:italic>, a new ensemble method that enables comparative analysis of TF motifs between multiple high-throughput sequencing experiments, such as ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. Using a collection of ~200 H3K27ac ChIP-seq data sets we identify TFs that play a role in hematopoietic differentiation and lineage commitment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>GimmeMotifs is a fully-featured and flexible framework for TF motif analysis.

This was recently achieved for a single gene by exploiting negative autoregulation by the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and bicistronic gene expression to reduce gene expression noise. We report new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes. The TetR system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the <jats:italic>lac</jats:italic> repressor (LacI) was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We characterize gene expression mean and noise across the range of induction levels for these plasmids, apply the LacI system to tune expression for single-molecule mRNA detection in two different growth conditions, and show that two plasmids can be co-transformed to independently tune expression of two different genes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Urea solution is one of the most commonly employed protein denaturants for protease digestion in proteomic studies. However, it has long been recognized that urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues. Protein/peptide carbamylation blocks protease digestion and affects protein identification and quantification in mass spectrometry analysis by blocking peptide amino groups from isotopic/isobaric labeling and changing peptide charge states, retention times, and masses. In addition, protein carbamylation during sample preparation makes it difficult to study in vivo protein carbamylation. In this study, we compared the peptide carbamylation in urea solutions of different buffers and found that ammonium-containing buffers were the most effective buffers to inhibit protein carbamylation in urea solution. The possible mechanism of carbamylation inhibition by ammonium-containing buffers is discussed, and a revised procedure for the protease digestion of proteins in urea and ammonium-containing buffers was developed to facilitate its application in proteomic research.

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.",
